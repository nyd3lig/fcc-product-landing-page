This is a project from the freecodecamp curriculum called Build a Product Landing Page.

Live: https://nyd3lig.github.io/fcc-product-landing-page/

The fonts I used are Lakki Reddy and Arimo.
The illustration is from absurd.design.

So before I started the project, I wrote down all the requierments from FCC

which can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page

and I thought about how I could implement these, while having it look decent, cause I atleast want things to look.. somewhat pretty.

So I made some designs in figma which can be found in the design-mockups folder.

Before starting this, I watched a short video on responsive design which mentioned the units VH and VW and combining them with the pixel unit using some calc() function.

So I was playing a little bit around with that, and overall it made things more responsive than what I have made previously.

But I still feel like the responsive web development subject is a little over my head at the moment, but regardless it was fun trying.

The fixed nav bar gave me a headache, until I figured you need to apply a top: 0; to have it fixed to the top (Was adding margins to try and push things around, just made everything more messy)
